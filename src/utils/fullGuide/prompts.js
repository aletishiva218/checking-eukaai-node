Your task is to identify the company, research it thoroughly, and generate a detailed JSON output containing key information relevant for interview preparation.
${data}
----

*INSTRUCTIONS:*

1. Identify Company:
    - Start with the 'COMPANY NAME' provided in the input as the primary candidate.
    - **Crucially, use the 'COMPANY WEBSITE' (if available in the input) to disambiguate this name.** Analyze its domain to distinguish this specific company from others that might share a similar name. This step is vital for pinpointing the exact entity the user is referring to.
    - Further refine and confirm the specific company identity by analyzing the 'JOB DESCRIPTION'. Look for contextual clues (industry, services mentioned, specific technologies, location if relevant) that align with the website information and the provided company name, helping to resolve any remaining ambiguity.
    - Your objective is to accurately determine and confirm the single, specific company entity intended by the user for subsequent research.

Research: **Using the identified company name, leverage your general knowledge base for a foundational understanding of the company (e.g., its industry, general product categories, common perceptions). However, to ensure the highest accuracy and up-to-date information for specific factual and potentially time-sensitive details, you **must prioritize and actively employ your searching grounding (searching the internet) capabilities.** Aim for comprehensive information, using search to validate, update, or find details that are likely to be current or highly specific.This approach is especially critical for gathering precise information on:

- Mission & Values
- Founding Team - Company founding date & Key founder(s)
- Products & Services
- Business Model & Market Footprint
- Recent funding rounds (including amounts, dates, and key investors, if publicly available)
- Key recent events (e.g., significant news, major product launches, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, ideally within the last 1-2 years)
- Current key leadership roles and names (e.g., CEO, CPO, CTO)
- Specific financial details (e.g., revenue trends if public, latest valuation if reported)
- Notable clients/customers (verifying publicly acknowledged relationships)

-----

REQUIRED INFORMATION CATEGORIES (Map these to the JSON structure):

- ***Quick Summary:*** High-impact overview (~2 mins) covering: What the company does, its primary product/service, key customer segment & problem solved & company's advantage
- **Company Overview:**
    - **Company Snapshot:** 3–4 sentence summary explaining what the company does, its core product or service, key innovation, and why it matters in its industry
    - **Mission & Values: Instruction - This information should not be inferred or guessed, it should be searched on the web for the most accurate result**
        - Mission: 1 sentence stating the mission statement of the company, if available
        - Vision: 1 sentence stating the vision statement of the company, if available
        - Values/Principles: List all the values/principles of the company, if available
    - **Founding Team:** String (In 1-2 sentences, state the *year* company_name was founded and list *all the names* *e.g. name(job title)* of its founders entirely from web search) e.g. *The founders of company_name are name1(job title), name2(job title), name3(job title),etc.*
- **Products & Services: Instruction:** - Your primary task here is to thoroughly search the web, especially the company's official website (navigating their "Products," "Services," "Solutions," or equivalent sections), to identify and list all of the company's *main, distinct* products and/or service lines.
    - **Distinguishing Main Products from Features:** If a company offers a primary product that has many features or sub-components, list the *main product* as the offering. Only list sub-components or features as separate "Product/Service" entries if the company markets and presents them as distinct, standalone offerings. The goal is to reflect how the company categorizes and presents its offerings to the market.
    - **Handling Numerous Offerings:** For companies with an extensive portfolio of many distinct products/services, strive to list all *major* or *primary* offerings. If the list becomes exceptionally long (e.g., dozens of minor variations), prioritize those that appear most strategically important, are highlighted by the company, or (if a job description is part of the input) are most relevant to the role. However, the initial goal should be to capture the breadth of their main offerings.
    - **Description:** For each distinct product or service identified, provide its name followed by a concise 1-2 line description detailing what it is and its core function or benefit.
    - **Source Verification:** This information MUST be actively searched and verified online. Prioritize the company's official website and reputable industry sources. Do not rely solely on general knowledge, as product portfolios change.
    Example Format (to be followed for each entry in the JSON subPoints):
    - [Product/Service Name 1:** [Concise 1-2 sentence description of Product/Service 1.]
    - [Product/Service Name 2:** [Concise 1-2 sentence description of Product/Service 2.] ad keep repeat for all offerings found
- **Business Model & Company Financials:**
    - **Business Model & Monetization: 1- 3 points outlining what is the b primary business model of the company**
    - **- **Financials & Funding: Instructions for Research and Formatting:**
    - **General Goal:** Provide a concise overview of the company's recent funding history. All information must be sourced from reliable web searches.
    - **For Privately Held Companies:**
        - **Objective:** Provide a comprehensive list of funding rounds, with a primary focus on the last 5 years, and also capturing essential earlier rounds if funding history is sparse.
        - **Instruction:** Actively search for all known funding rounds.
            - **Your primary goal is to list ALL distinct funding rounds announced in the past 5 years.** For each round, include its type (e.g., Seed, Series A, Pre-seed), amount, date (Month/Year or Q#/Year), and key/lead investors. Include all rounds found within this 5-year period, regardless of how many there are.
            - **Additionally, if the company has had very few funding rounds in total (e.g., only 1-2 rounds ever) and these foundational rounds are older than 5 years, ensure these are also listed.** The aim is to provide a complete funding picture where possible.
        - **Example for a subPoint string (to be used for each funding round listed in the JSON subPoints):** "Series C - $120M - May 2023 - led by Sequoia, participation from Accel."
    - **For Publicly Traded Companies (e.g., those that have had an IPO):**
        - **First subPoint string should typically state:** The company's public status, its stock ticker, the exchange it trades on, and its IPO date and key details (e.g., "Went public via IPO on NASDAQ (Ticker: GOOGL) on August 19, 2004, raising $1.67 billion.").
        - **Subsequent subPoint strings (if applicable and significant recent events exist):** Detail any major post-IPO financing events like significant secondary offerings, large debt financing rounds, or major investments received. If no such recent, distinct "funding rounds" exist post-IPO, this can be briefly stated, or the IPO information might be the primary focus for funding history.
        - **Avoid generic placeholders.** If specific post-IPO funding events aren't prominent, focus on the IPO details and current public market funding.
    - **Formatting in JSON:** Each piece of funding information (whether a private round or a public company detail) should be a single string within the *subPoints* array for "Financials & Funding".
    - **Revenue:** List the most up to date revenue available of the company. Do not guess this number, if its not publicly available then mention as such. For companies that are public this number should be easily available. If the company is private focus on reputable news sources.
- **Target Market & Customers:**
    - Primary Customer Segments: Provide a 3-5 sentence summary of key industries, sectors or target market that the company serves, if they serve multiple industries then focus on the main industry they serve with the product mentioned in the job description. A
    - Key Customer Challenges Solved: Problems/needs addressed by products/services.
    - Key Reasons Customers Choose: Top 2-3 USPs/differentiators.
    - Notable Clients: 5-7 significant clients that the company has worked with (publicly known)

    ${data} Description (JD)
    ----
    *INSTRUCTIONS:*

1. Identify Primary Focus Product:
    - Start by carefully reading the **'JOB DESCRIPTION (JD)'** provided in the input to identify ALL specific products, product lines, platforms, or teams mentioned (e.g., "Search", "Maps", "Assistant", "Cloud Platform").
    - Analyze the JD for **PM Responsibility Signals**: Look specifically within "Responsibilities", "What You'll Do", etc., for keywords indicating direct ownership or primary focus for the PM role (e.g., "own the roadmap for [Product X]", "define the strategy for [Product X]").
    - **Crucially, use the 'COMPANY Name or Company WEBSITE URL' (provided in the input) to confirm the existence and details of any product(s) identified from the JD.** This step is vital for pinpointing the exact product offering.
    - **Fallback Logic:** If no specific product is clearly identified for PM ownership in the JD, attempt to identify the company's main/flagship product relevant to the role from the **'COMPANY WEBSITE'**. If still unclear, identify the most relevant product category/business line from the website.
    - Your objective is to accurately determine and confirm the single, **Primary Focus Product** (or product category) for subsequent research. Other mentioned products can be considered **Contextual Products**.
2. Research Product Details: **Using the identified Primary Focus Product, conduct your deep research.**

        <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold text-gray-50'>1. Clarify and Get Context</h2>\
        <p class='text-gray-300'>Before diving into solutions, ask clarifying questions to ensure you and the interviewer are on the same page. Key questions include: 'Who are we solving for specifically?', 'What is the primary goal of this design challenge?', 'Are there any specific constraints (e.g., budget, time, technology)?', 'Is this intended for a mobile app, web platform, or another medium?' Clarifying upfront helps align your solution with the interviewer's expectations and demonstrates thoughtful problem-solving.</p>\
        <hr class='my-4 border-gray-700'>\
\
        <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold text-gray-50'>2. Mission/Vision Alignment</h2>\
        <p class='text-gray-300'>If the question pertains to a known company, tie your proposed solution back to its overarching mission and vision. This shows you understand the company's strategic direction. If it's a hypothetical scenario or an unknown company, state your assumptions about its mission clearly. For example, 'I will assume the mission is to connect people through shared experiences.' This establishes a guiding principle for your design.</p>\
        <hr class='my-4 border-gray-700'>\
\
        <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold text-gray-50'>3. Define Personas (User Groups)</h2>\
        <p class='text-gray-300'>Identify 2-4 distinct user types who would interact with your product. For each persona, consider their goals, motivations, behaviors, and pain points. Prioritize these personas based on factors like their need intensity, frequency of use, or alignment with overall business goals. For example: 'For a trail-finding app, our primary personas might be: avid hikers seeking challenging routes, casual walkers looking for scenic strolls, and tourists interested in local landmarks.'</p>\
        <hr class='my-4 border-gray-700'>\
\
        <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold text-gray-50'>4. User Journey</h2>\
        <p class='text-gray-300'>Map out the typical user's flow through the product, from their initial interaction to achieving their goal. This helps identify key touchpoints and potential areas of friction. For example, for an e-commerce platform, the user journey might be: Search -> Filter -> View Product Details -> Add to Cart -> Checkout -> Receive Order -> Review Product.</p>\
        <hr class='my-4 border-gray-700'>\
\
        <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold text-gray-50'>5. Identify User Pain Points and Opportunities</h2>\
        <p class='text-gray-300'>Based on your user journey, pinpoint specific points of friction, unmet needs, or frustrations that users might experience. These are your pain points, which represent opportunities for improvement or new features. Focus on the high-impact problems that, if solved, would significantly improve the user experience or align with business objectives. For instance, 'Users struggle with inaccurate filters leading to irrelevant search results,' or 'There's no easy way to save favorite items for later.'</p>\
        <hr class='my-4 border-gray-700'>\
\
        <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold text-gray-50'>6. Brainstorm Possible Solutions</h2>\
        <p class='text-gray-300'>Once pain points are clear, brainstorm a range of potential solutions. Don't limit yourself initially; think broadly from simple tweaks to innovative new features. After brainstorming, evaluate each idea for its feasibility (technical, resource, time), alignment with the product's mission, and potential measurable impact on users and business. This often involves discussing trade-offs.</p>\
        <hr class='my-4 border-gray-700'>\
\
        <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold text-gray-50'>7. Define a Product Vision</h2>\
        <p class='text-gray-300'>Before prioritizing specific features, articulate a concise product vision or a 'north star' statement. This summarizes the overarching goal of your proposed design. Example: 'Our product vision is to create a mobile-first trail finder that empowers users of all experience levels to easily discover and navigate personalized hiking routes, fostering a community through social recommendations.'</p>\
        <hr class='my-4 border-gray-700'>\
\
        <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold text-gray-50'>8. Prioritize Features</h2>\
        <p class='text-gray-300'>Given your brainstormed solutions, prioritize which features to build first, especially for an Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Use common frameworks like RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) or MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have for now). Select features that deliver significant value quickly, address critical pain points, and allow for learning and iteration. Clearly explain your prioritization rationale.</p>\
        <hr class='my-4 border-gray-700'>\
\
        <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold text-gray-50'>9. Success Metrics</h2>\
        <p class='text-gray-300'>Define how you will measure the success of your proposed design. Choose relevant metrics that align with your product vision and address the pain points you aimed to solve. Consider a mix of quantitative (e.g., engagement rate, retention rate, task completion rate, conversion rate) and qualitative (e.g., Net Promoter Score (NPS), user feedback) metrics. Differentiate between initial MVP success metrics and long-term full rollout metrics.</p>\
